# Requirements

This page lists all the requirements.

## Server

The Server is developed with the following **Eclipse IDE** version:

- **Version**: 2022-12
- **Download**: <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>

You also need the following installations:

- **Java 11 JDK**: To start the different servers
- **Java 17 JRE**: To run the Eclipse IDE

## Client

Use the IDE of your choice, but **VSCode** is recommended.

- **VSCode**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>
- **Node v16.19.1**: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/>
  - Or use NVM, see below
- **Yarn 2+**: <https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install>

### Optional

It is recommended to use NVM. NVM allows you to manage different versions of Node. You can therefore install the required version for this repository and then switch again to the latest version for your other projects.
